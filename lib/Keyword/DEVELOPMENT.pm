=head1 NAME

Keyword::DEVELOPMENT - Have code blocks which don't exist unless you ask for them.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.04

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.06';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Keyword::DEVELOPMENT;

    sub foo {
        my $self = shift;
        DEVELOPMENT {
            $self->expensive_debugging_code;
        }
        ...
    }

=head1 EXPORT

=head2 DEVELOPMENT

This module exports one keyword, C<DEVELOPMENT>. This keyword takes a code
block.

If the environment variable C<PERL_KEYWORD_DEVELOPMENT> is set to a true
value, the code block is executed. Otherwise, the entire block is removed at
compile-time, thus ensuring that there is no runtime overhead for the block.

ALternatively, you can set the C<PERL_KEYWORD_DEVELOPMENT_MATCH> variable to a
valid Perl regular expression to only run C<DEVELOPMENT> blocks in packages
matching the regex.

This is primarily a development tool for performance-critical code.

sub import {
    my $caller = caller;

    my $match = $ENV{PERL_KEYWORD_DEVELOPMENT_MATCH};
    if ( defined $match ) {
        $ENV{PERL_KEYWORD_DEVELOPMENT} = 1;
        my $success = eval { qr/$match/; 1 };
        unless ($success) {
            my $error = $@;
            croak(
"PERL_KEYWORD_DEVELOPMENT_MATCH environment variable '$ENV{PERL_KEYWORD_DEVELOPMENT_MATCH}' is not a valid regex: $error"
            );
        }
    }

    Keyword::Simple::define 'DEVELOPMENT', sub {
        my $in_development = 0;
        my ($ref) = @_;
        if ( $ENV{PERL_KEYWORD_DEVELOPMENT} ) {
            if ( defined $match ) {
                $in_development = $caller =~ /$match/ ? 1 : 0;
            }
            else {
                $in_development = 1;
            }
        }
        substr( $$ref, 0, 0 ) = "if ($in_development)";
    };
}

sub unimport {
    Keyword::Simple::undefine 'DEVELOPMENT';
}

=head1 EXAMPLE

Consider the following code:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    BEGIN {
        # just in case someone turned this off
        $ENV{PERL_KEYWORD_DEVELOPMENT} = 1;
    }
    use lib 'lib';
    use Keyword::DEVELOPMENT;

    my $value = 0;
    DEVELOPMENT {
        sleep 10;
        $value = 1;
    }

    print "Our value is $value";

Running this code should print the following after about 10 seconds:

    Our value is 1

However, if you set C<PERL_KEYWORD_DEVELOPMENT> to C<0> in the C<BEGIN> block, it prints:

    Our value is 0

To know that we really have B<no> overhead during production, run the code under the debugger
with C<PERL_KEYWORD_DEVELOPMENT> set to C<0>.

    $ perl -d development.pl

    Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl version 1.49_04
    Editor support available.

    Enter h or 'h h' for help, or 'man perldebug' for more help.

    main::(development.pl:10):    my $value = 0;
    auto(-1)  DB<1> {{v
    DB<2> n
    main::(development.pl:10):    my $value = 0;
    auto(-1)  DB<2> v
    7:    use lib 'lib';
    8:    use Keyword::DEVELOPMENT;
    9
    10==>    my $value = 0;

    11     # PERL_KEYWORD_DEVELOPMENT was false, so the development code was removed.
    12     #KDCT:_:_:1 DEVELOPMENT
    13     #line 14 development.pl
    14
    15
    16:    print "Our value is $value";
    DB<2>

As you can see, there are only comments there, no code.

Note the handy line directive on line 13 to ensure your line numbers remain
correct. If you're not familiar with line directives, see

=head1 MATCHING PACKAGES

If you use C<Keyword::DEVELOPMENT> extensively, you may find that the
C<DEVELOPMENT> block is called too frequently. As of version 0.05, an
experimental feature has been added to allow you to only invoke C<DEVELOPMENT>
blocks in packages matching a regex. Set the C<PERL_KEYWORD_DEVELOPMENT_MATCH>
variable to a Perl regular expression instead of the
C<PERL_KEYWORD_DEVELOPMENT> variable. Only packages whose names match the
regular expression will have their C<DEVELOPMENT> block triggered.

    PERL_KEYWORD_DEVELOPMENT_MATCH='^(?:Our::Codebase::|Our::MonkeyPatches::)' \
        perl some_code.pl

The above will only run C<DEVELOPMENT> for packages whose package names start
with C<Our::Codebase::> or C<Our::MonkeyPatches::>.

=head1 ALTERNATIVES

As SawyerX pointed out, can replicate the functionality of this module in pure
Perl, if desired:

    use constant PRODUCTION => !!$ENV{PRODUCTION};
    do {expensive_debugging_code()} unless PRODUCTION;

Versus:

    use Keyword::DEVELOPMENT;
    DEVELOPMENT {expensive_debugging_code()};

The first version works because the line is removed entirely from the source
code using constant-folding (if C<PRODUCTION> evaluates to false during
compile time, the entire line will be omitted).

I think C<Keyword::DEVELOPMENT> is less fragile in that you never need to
remember the C<unless PRODUCTION> statement modifier. However, we do rely on
the pluggable keyword functionality introduced in 5.012. Be warned!
